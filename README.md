========

Hiveway is to become a direct democratic social network, running fully autonomously. It is a fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Its users will be able to post and interact with messages, photos and videos. The social platform will be ruled by its users, through an electoral system, with technocratic values. Â The users will receive the right to vote on the development of the platform, to run for a position in managing it, and to vote the candidates they believe more competent for each position.
